## Week 2 - 29/09/2020 (Duration: 1 Hour)
Dr. Olaosebikan and I introduced ourselves to each other and discussed the project broadly. We decided that our primary aim will be to develop the core of the web platform which includes students who study as Undergraduates and above selecting from the project proposals of the supervisors. After that a small testing and evaluation will be held in order eliminate bugs and faults of the platform to have a strong core. The testing may be a collaboration of 20-30 supervisors and about 100 students that Dr. Olaosebikan has already contacted. I will be looking at similar projects and research papers in order to get an idea about the implementation and design of the project. 

## Week 3 - 06/10/2020 (Duration: 1.5 hours)
I briefly went over what has been achieved in week 2. While talking about the core of the project, we realised some potential problems. Firstly, there might be a balancing problem between the number of academics and the researchers. I proposed an idea of either manually or automatically locking down the registration feature to the platform in case of an unbalancing. For example: If the number of researchers are too many, do not show the registration page until the ratio is stabilised again and vice versa. Second issue was about the actions needed when there are researchers who might waste the time of the academics by doing unethical actions such as applying to project and not taking the work seriously. I proposed the idea of a marking/reporting system for the researchers where the feedback will be given by an academic at any time they want to. This feedback will be delivered to the administration board to be investigated and the admin will have the right to ban/remove/unassign the researcher. Due to these functionalities, we decided that an admin interface will be handy and also for checking the statistics of the platform. Dr. Olaosebikan proposed that it will be better if the availability of a project and an academic is determined by a capacity feature which will be determined by an academic so, we agreed on applying it. Another issue was about whether or not giving the academics the ability to choose a researcher for a project by looking at their profiles. We agreed on that they should have a chance to select the researcher and to make their work easier I suggested that the results of matching algorithm can also be used to show the best matching researchers with the project to the academic. Finally, Dr. Olaosebikan suggested that the matching of researchers to the projects should be done in a certain time period such as once in every month so, we decided that the users will be able to propose, apply and view the projects at any time but there will be no matching except certain dates. This will also be controlled by the admin interface by giving an option of open/close the matching system or again automate the system. 

## Week 4 - 13/10/2020 (Duration: 0.5 hour)
I showed what has been achieved so far in week 3, which mainly included the front-end development of the landing page. Dr. Olaosebikan approved the initial design ideas and we agreed on that a live carousel might be better for the categories displayed. However, I should find a proper way of filtering the images so that no copyright problems arise in the future. Additionally, Dr. Olaosebikan proposed the idea of reviewing after a mentoring is finished by rating over 5 stars and leaving a comment. Finally, I showed my whole-year plan just to be on the same page. 

## Week 5 - 20/10/2020 (Duration: 0.5 hour)
I have showed the achievements made on the back end of the application. This included the server handling the users signing in and registering by using the forms. Additionally, server is also connected to a PSQL database which registers users into a table and stores their encrypted passwords in another table making it so hard to be hacked and deciphered. Other than the front end, an about us page is filled with lorem ipsum text just to make it look more full. We approved our previous decision of focusing on the functionality and leaving the design to a later date. Lastly, I have suggested a solution to the problem of using copyrighted images on the website, which includes using an API of unsplash.com. The final decision about this will be made in a later stage. 

## Week 6 - 27/10/2020 (Duration: 0.5 hour)
I have described the improvements made on the app to Dr. Olaosebikan and provided a short demonstration. This demo included the upgrades made to the menu bar such as hiding and showing the necessary navigation links according to the sign-in state and fixes made to the automatic navigation when a user registers/signs in. Additionally, I have showed what happens when a new project is created, which is dynamically presented on the projects page. Even though some of the functionalities is missing, Dr. Olaosebikan approved the rest and also the rate of the progress. 

## Week 7 - 03/11/2020 (Duration: 0)
Meeting postponed. 


## Week 8 - 10/11/2020
(No information)


## Week 9 - 19/11/2020 (Duration: 0.5 hour)
In this meeting, I have demonstrated to Dr. Olaosebikan what I have acheived in the past week. More importantly, we have agreed on the Moscow Principles I have prepared for the remaining of the project in order to prioritise the features. An important criteria affecting the principles was to decreasing the focus on each aspect that would slow down the testing phase of the app such as admin interface. Finally, we have decided on to put the image gathering API to pause until a good solution is found. 


## Week 10 - 26/11/2020 (Duration: 0.5 hour)
I showed the new features to Dr. Olaosebikan which included seeing who applied to projects from the perspective of academics, academics being able to decide on whether or not to approve a project application of a researcher, and finally the ability of a researcher to withdraw from an applied project. Additionally, we have agreed on to demonstrate the application to a researcher and an academic to obtain a certain amount of feedback about the general idea of the application and the user experience/interface. 

## Week 11 - 03/12/2020 (Duration: 1.5 hours)
This meeting was a special one as the application demonstrated to a researcher and an academic to get their general opinions. First, the application has shown to the academic and we got very useful feedback. According to her, putting a capacity on the project applications is a must have feature and dividing the project description into smaller pieces with more distinguished labels would be beneficial for academics. She also added that the matching algorithm would be too complicated due to the nature of the application and it is sufficient enough for academics to decide on the applications. Finally, she added that archiving past projects would be also beneficial. On the other hand, our researcher participant really liked the general idea of the application and its current version, even though it requires so many improvements. 

## Week 12 
(No meeting occured)

# Winter Semester

## Week 13 (Duration: 1 hour) 
At this meeting, I have demonstrated to Dr. Olaosebikan what has been achieved since the previous meeting. We have found some missing and wrong parts throughout the demonstration such as: the example field text being missing in the project tags field, the example field text in the minimum requirements being ambigous so, more descriptive text will be added like "good knowledge of Python".

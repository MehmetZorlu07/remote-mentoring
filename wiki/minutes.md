## Week 2 - 29/09/2020 
Dr. Olaosebikan and I introduced ourselves to each other and discussed the project broadly. We decided that our primary aim will be to develop the core of the web platform which includes students who study as Undergraduates and above selecting from the project proposals of the supervisors. After that a small testing and evaluation will be held in order eliminate bugs and faults of the platform to have a strong core. The testing may be a collaboration of 20-30 supervisors and about 100 students that Dr. Olaosebikan has already contacted. I will be looking at similar projects and research papers in order to get an idea about the implementation and design of the project.

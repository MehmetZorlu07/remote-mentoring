**These are the questions and ideas asked to the supervisor with the reply followed after.**

## Week 1

* Am I allowed to spend more than 15 hours/week on the project or will I lose marks for it?
_-Work hour can depend on how busy the week is. It should be 15 hours/week on average. You won't lose marks for it._
* Do the references need to be only academic or the ones that are non-academic but were helpful in coding/researching can also be added to manager? _-You are free to use non-academic resources if they are useful for the project._
* Organising a yearly schedule?
_-The meetings will be on Tuesday at 15:30 UK time._
* Thinking about doing background research (any initial suggestions to start?) _-I will send you 3 links of related software platforms to start with._
* GitLab vs. GitHub? Private vs. Public repo? _-GitHub is suitable for the project and it should be a private repo._
* Would you approve an agenda for each meeting? _-An agenda is not needed for the meeting as it would decrease the flexibility of the discussion._
* Would you approve a status report 24 hours before the meeting? _-Yes a status report would be suitable._ 
* Name for the project? _-It's not decided yet. Notify me if anything pops up in your mind._

**These are the questions and ideas asked to the supervisor with the reply followed after.**

## Week 1

* Am I allowed to spend more than 15 hours/week on the project or will I lose marks for it?
_-Work hour can depend on how busy the week is. It should be 15 hours/week on average. You won't lose marks for it._
* Do the references need to be only academic or the ones that are non-academic but were helpful in coding/researching can also be added to manager? _-You are free to use non-academic resources if they are useful for the project._
* Organising a yearly schedule?
_-The meetings will be on Tuesday at 15:30 UK time._
* Thinking about doing background research (any initial suggestions to start?) _-I will send you 3 links of related software platforms to start with._
* GitLab vs. GitHub? Private vs. Public repo? _-GitHub is suitable for the project and it should be a private repo._
* Would you approve an agenda for each meeting? _-An agenda is not needed for the meeting as it would decrease the flexibility of the discussion._
* Would you approve a status report 24 hours before the meeting? _-Yes a status report would be suitable._ 
* Name for the project? _-It's not decided yet. Notify me if anything pops up in your mind._


## Week 2

* Should the researchers have the option of withdrawing their application to a project? _-Yes but for a certain period of time after they apply for a project._
* What happens after a researcher applies for a project? 
  * Idea: E-mail notification both to the researcher ("you have applied...") and the academic ("Click to go to the application"). Additionally a notification to the academic within the web platform which will be in a pending state until there is a reply. (incremental notification above an icon) _-E-mail notification to the researcher is fine but academics should not recieve e-mail notifications as there will be too many to deal with. Incremental notification above an icon is a good idea._
* Is the relationship of student and the project many to 1 or many to many? (can a student apply to more than one project before it's finished?) _-A project can be applied by more than one researchers. However, the number of researchers will be determined by the academic per project. It can be one or more than one which depends on the academic's decision. Additionally, a researcher can apply to more than one projects but only work on one._
* Would you like an admin interface in website which will show you the statistics like project number? _-Yes an admin interface will be a nice feature to have control over the platform._
* Should the academics have tags too to show their area of profesionalism? (Researcher may search for an academic first to look at their proposed projects.) _-Yes it will be better if the academics also have tags so that researchers can search for them too._
* Name idea: RMRAfrica or RSRAfrica. Inspired from PWSAfrica. May be a good idea if you want to connect/refer the sites in the future?_-I have other options for the name idea but there is still time to find one so do not worry about it._


## Week 3
* Should I deploy the project to GitHub Pages so that it's easier to follow the latest product? (note that repo is going to be public) _-Think about the privacy issues before doing that as the repo is going to be public there may be ideas stolen from our project._

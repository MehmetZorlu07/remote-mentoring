## Status Report of Week 2 
As discussed in the last meeting and planned for the week, I have made a research on the similar websites to analyse their design and technologies. Using the results from the researches and the discussion of the core features of the web platform, I have created fundamental documents including: A minimum viable product, detailed features of the MVP, a mind map of the MVP, entity-relationship diagram for the MVP and a site-map for the MVP. I do believe that these documents will help to maximise the communication and eliminate the misunderstandings. Additionally, I have created an initial React.js webapp that is ready to be developed so the set-up and planning of the project is complete. Finally, I have finished the set-up of the version control system and spent some significant time on the wiki of the repository in order to have a well-designed structure throughout the project and I believe that this structure will minimise the time spent on looking for a documentation both for me and my supervisor. 

## Status Report of Week 3
I have started working on the development phase of the application and basic landing page components have been created including: a navigation bar, a hero part, a small carousel for categories and a footer bar. 

## Status Report of Week 4
I couldn't achieve all of my goals this week. However, I have managed to create a server and connect it to the front-end which allows a user to login. An initial about us page is also created just to fill in the blanks. My aim is to create a database and connect it to the server before the meeting. 

## Status Report of Week 5
The automatic navigation problem when the sign-in and register buttons were clicked is fixed. Sign-out feature is now added to the application. I have started working on the "projects" part of the application which is a bit challenging. A database table for the project is created, the initial frontend components are also made but server needs to connect to the frontend which I aim to do it tomorrow before the meeting. 

## Status Reports of Week 6 and 7
The database system has been updated on a large scale. Some of the tables have been re-constructed. The registration form has been updated so that all entries for fields are captured now. A single page can be displayed now which has the details of a specific project. The researchers can apply to the projects if they are eligible (not applied before). Academics have an interface for creating a project which captures the projects details via a form. Currently, I am working on the functionality of editing and deleting a project as an academic.

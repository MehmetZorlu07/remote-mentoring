## Status Report of Week 2 
As discussed in the last meeting and planned for the week, I have made a research on the similar websites to analyse their design and technologies. Using the results from the researches and the discussion of the core features of the web platform, I have created fundamental documents including: A minimum viable product, detailed features of the MVP, a mind map of the MVP, entity-relationship diagram for the MVP and a site-map for the MVP. I do believe that these documents will help to maximise the communication and eliminate the misunderstandings. Additionally, I have created an initial React.js webapp that is ready to be developed so the set-up and planning of the project is complete. Finally, I have finished the set-up of the version control system and spent some significant time on the wiki of the repository in order to have a well-designed structure throughout the project and I believe that this structure will minimise the time spent on looking for a documentation both for me and my supervisor. 

## Status Report of Week 3
I have started working on the development phase of the application and basic landing page components have been created including: a navigation bar, a hero part, a small carousel for categories and a footer bar. 

## Status Report of Week 4
I couldn't achieve all of my goals this week. However, I have managed to create a server and connect it to the front-end which allows a user to login. An initial about us page is also created just to fill in the blanks. My aim is to create a database and connect it to the server before the meeting. 

## Status Report of Week 5
The automatic navigation problem when the sign-in and register buttons were clicked is fixed. Sign-out feature is now added to the application. I have started working on the "projects" part of the application which is a bit challenging. A database table for the project is created, the initial frontend components are also made but server needs to connect to the frontend which I aim to do it tomorrow before the meeting. 

## Status Reports of Week 6 and 7
The database system has been updated on a large scale. Some of the tables have been re-constructed. The registration form has been updated so that all entries for fields are captured now. A single page can be displayed now which has the details of a specific project. The researchers can apply to the projects if they are eligible (not applied before). Academics have an interface for creating a project which captures the projects details via a form. Currently, I am working on the functionality of editing and deleting a project as an academic. 

## Status Report of Week 8
Dummy data is created for projects so that it's easier to repopulate the database. A research is conducted on how to test and evaluate the application. The functionality for editing the projects is fully working now. Additionally, an apply button is created for researchers to be able to apply to the projects under right conditions. I made a research about how to "delete" a project. Unfortunately my pc crashed so, I gave it to the repairing. 

## Status Report of Week 9
I got my pc back and re-built my development environment. My projects page is created which presents the users all the projects that they are related. If the user is a researcher, applied-approved-declined projects are displayed and if the user is an academic, all the projects they have created are displayed. To add to this, My Account page is created which displays the users their own profile data. Finally, deleting a project functionality is successfully implemented for academics. 

## Status Report of Week 10
The functionality for displaying all the researchers related to a project is implemented for academics. In this week, it took me a very long time to accomplish the functionality of approving/declining a project by academics due to lots of debugging. My aim was to finish all 5 must have features in Moscow Principles but I could only do 2. Finally, I have implemented the functionality of a researcher withdrawing their application from a project.

## Status Report of Week 13
A contact us form page has been created where the users must tick a reCaptcha made by Google in order to prove that they are not a robot. This will minimise the spam e-mails. To add to this, the project capacity feature has been implemented which I will demonstrate how it's used and how it affects the users. After this feature, open/ongoing/closed projects feature has been implemented to the application. Finally, the issues we discussed in the last meeting have been fixed which includes: 1) The example field placeholder for Projects Tags was missing, 2) The example field placeholder for minimum requirements was ambigous. My aim for today before the meeting is to start implementing the marking/reviewing system.

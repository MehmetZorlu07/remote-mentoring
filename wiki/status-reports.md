## Status Report of Week 2 
As discussed in the last meeting and planned for the week, I have made a research on the similar websites to analyse their design and technologies. Using the results from the researches and the discussion of the core features of the web platform, I have created fundamental documents including: A minimum viable product, detailed features of the MVP, a mind map of the MVP, entity-relationship diagram for the MVP and a site-map for the MVP. I do believe that these documents will help to maximise the communication and eliminate the misunderstandings. Additionally, I have created an inital React.js webapp that is ready to be developed so the set-up and planning of the project is complete. Finally, I have finished the set-up of the version control system and spent some significant time on the wiki of the repository in order to have a well-designed structure throughout the project and I believe that this structure will minimise the time spent on looking for a documentation both for me and my supervisor.
